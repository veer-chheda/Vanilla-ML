I took a break yesterday. Today I aim to finish leftover stuff from 6th and start something new today!

TO DO:
 - ~~Fix module import errors.~~
 - ~~Test linear regression.~~
 - ~~Implement accuracy calculators.~~
 - ~~Test data loading.~~
 - Implement dimensionality reduction.
 - Implement plots.
 - Fix one-hot encoding.
 - Implement logistic regression.


Key points:   
 - Normalizing the columns worked better than standardization for some reason.
 - Need to implement plots for linear regression, but in order to do that I need to first implement dimensionality reduction. I will try exploring PCA and LDA.
 - After that I can start with logistic regression and fix one-hot encoding for categorical labeling.
