Starting with linear regression today! 

TO DO:  
 - ~~Implement a class for regression.~~
 - ~~Figure out parameters for the class.~~
 - ~~Implement gradient descent optimization.~~
 - Maybe implement least square approximation as well?
 - ~~Implement utils for data loading, visualization, etc.~~
 - Fix one-hot encoding and test if it works.
 - Check data loading and conversion from Pandas to Numpy.
